  -yes, we should overload it
5.Thread communication within Threadpool
  using wait/notifyAll
6.How do you create ThreadPoolExecutor
   ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPoolExecutor();
7.SerialVersionID
  will be use full while deserializing the object
8.Volatile vs transient
 -Volatile will make sure that all the Threads should read data from mainmemory
 -Transient : the objects wont be serialized
9.SerialVersionId exception ->  InvalidClassException

10. Main Thread has to monitor set of threads how do you implement
   ThreadPoolExecutor

   which the object will 'depend' on in order to behave correctly.
